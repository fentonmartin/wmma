There are many expense trackers available for Android, why another one? Yes, there are a lot of expense trackers out there. They either have a ton of other features I dont need (budgets, income, bills, recurring payments to name a few) and/or they require you to create an account and sync your data to some webservice. I didnt want to give those services my data. Thus I created **WMMA - Where My Money At**
